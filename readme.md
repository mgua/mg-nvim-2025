# mgua's Neovim 2025 Setup

This is a work in progess. Requires at least neovim 0.11. 
On linux you may require to uninstall the distribution supported package, and install the newest version via snap.

Currently the windows part is ready, with working setup of main neovim, integrated with mason, treesitter, python, and with several command line tools.
Colors should be compatible (almost identical) to vscode/vscodium default color theme.

Linux setup should be quite straightforward, and rely on the same git clone, but in different folder under ~/.config/nvim
