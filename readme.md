# mgua's Neovim Modern Setup

This is my own version of neovim config, as updated at the beginning of 2025
I was using my previous setup based on TJ DeVries Kickstart until now and 
decided to upgrade. 

This configuration has a selection of plugins and also has a documentation,
(thanks to Claude).
Installation notes are focused just on windows 11 and Linux, mostly ubuntu.

This is very new setup, so expect something not to be working.

Important things that still should work:
for me it is fundamental to be able to copy/paste large portions of text 
across different operating system, and possibly across different terminal
sessions, from windows to linux. I standardize my actions on Microsoft WT 
(Windows Terminal) with some multiplatform tools.


enjoy!
